    <p class="p1"> The RSBP was founded in Didsbury, Manchester,<br>
    and the Chorlton meadows are literally a sanctuary for many wild species of bird,<br>
    as well as a few domestic escapees.<br> 
    Notably the parakeets, first seen in Fog Lane Park,<br>
    have established themselves around Turn Moss,<br>
    and provide a bright but noisy touch of the exotic.<br>
    More frequent sightings will be made of crows, gulls and the occasional kestrel.<br>
    Grey Herons are often seen, and prey on young ducklings, as well as fish.<br>

    <p class="p1"> The Water Park is also an important source of bird life,<br>
    and a live video feed was established in 2019 to observe them.<br>
    While more prosaic water fowl such as Canada geese, ducks and coots are common,<br>
    a patient watcher may witness the elaborate mating dances of the Great Crested Grebe(above).<br> 
    And according to urban myth, a Mute Swan can knock down a grown man!<br>
