    <p class="p1"> 'Ees' is an Anglo-saxon word for
    'water meadows', and Chorlton Ees refers to an area of natural beauty,<br>
    lying roughly between the north bank of the Mersey,<br>
    and the South Manchester suburb of Chorlton-Cum-Hardy.<br>
    Among its notable features are pleasant woodlands, a bird sanctuary, a wide expanse of fields,<br>
    and of course an attractive stretch of the Mersey itself. <br>
    Visitor activities can include team sports on Turn Moss playing fields,<br>
    walking, horse riding and cycling; or less vigorously, relaxing and picnicking.<br>
    Natural science wonders encompass varieties of trees, butterflies, dragon flies and birds. <br>
    Herons, kestrels and swifts mingle with alien species of parakeet.

    <div>
    <p class="p1"> Chorlton Waterpark is another striking feature of the area.<br>
    Located somewhat to the south-west of the Ees,<br>
    it attracts both visitors and several species of water fowl.<br>
    The ‘lake’ is very shallow, and surrounded on most sides by sloping, tree-shaded banks.<br>
    Most visit it to enjoy the natural environment and exercise,<br>
    but a few go to fish, by day or night.<br>
    Circling the Waterpark is a good exercise workout,<br>
    particularly the steeper slopes, known as Cardiac Hill by Merseyside Wardens.<br>
    However there are many nooks amongst the profusion of trees to spend a quieter day at the waterside.
