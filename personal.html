    <p class="p1">After living in South Manchester,<br>
    and specifically the Didsbury, Chorlton and Firswood areas, for over thirty years,<br>
    I’ve found the meadows as much a sanctuary as the wild life.<br>
    Within a fairly short walk or cycle ride is somewhere to see a lot of sky,<br>
    lie down in the grass or find some peace and quiet in the woods.<br>
    I was accustomed in particular to visit the Water Park when composing stories,<br>
    and cycled through it on my way to work in Wythenshawe Hospital.<br>
    More recently, the Ees eased the stress of the Lockdown.<br>

    <p class="p1"> Two particular personal stories are associated with the Ees.<br>
    The least sensational was my first encounter with a parakeet (above).<br>
    Knowing nothing about the stories of their escape,<br> 
    at first I thought I was imagining things.<br>
    But eventually I managed to get some (rather distant) photos,<br>
    to amaze my friends and family.<br> 
    Now they seem almost mundane, and are more of a nuisance,<br>
    with their extremely raucous cries. Unwelcome alien invaders!<br>

    <div>
    <p class="p1"> The other truly remarkable story was how,<br>
    after having my mountain bike stolen,<br>
    I happened to be pausing for refreshment in the well-known,<br>
    indeed only, pub in the area, Jackson’s Boat. (Over the bridge you can see in the picture).<br>
    I noticed a bike very like my own, and then realised it was so like as to be identical.<br>
    I confronted the new ‘owners’ and was able to persuade them to hand it over,<br>
    although my friends still josh me that I actually paid them some money.<br> 
    (I was worried they would skedaddle if I tried calling the police).<br> 
    Perhaps rather like the Italian film of the same name,<br>
    an entirely happy ending was unrealistic!<br>
